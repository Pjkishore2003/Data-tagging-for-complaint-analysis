# Data-tagging-for-complaint-analysis
This repository contains a tagged dataset for complaint classification, where free-text data (Complaint, Cause, Correction) is logically mapped to predefined categories from a taxonomy. The project involves data tagging based on Root Cause, Symptom_Condition, Symptom_Component, Fix_Condition, and Fix_Component.
# Data Tagging for Complaint Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves tagging free-text complaint data by aligning it with predefined taxonomy categories. The dataset consists of three main fields:
- **Complaint**
- **Cause**
- **Correction**

The tagging process assigns appropriate labels to each entry based on:
- **Root Cause**
- **Symptom_Condition**
- **Symptom_Component**
- **Fix_Condition**
- **Fix_Component**

## Dataset
- **Task Dataset:** Contains free-text complaints that require tagging.
- **Taxonomy Sheet:** Provides predefined categories for classification.
- **Tagged Dataset:** The final output with applied tags.

## Approach
1. **Understanding the Data**
   - Reviewed the provided complaint dataset and taxonomy sheet.
   - Analyzed sample tagged examples for reference.

2. **Tagging Methodology**
   - Applied logical reasoning to match free-text complaints to taxonomy categories.
   - Used keyword mapping, context understanding, and pattern recognition.
   - Handled ambiguous cases through best-fit categorization.

3. **Validation and Refinement**
   - Ensured tagging consistency across the dataset.
   - Cross-checked ambiguous entries and documented observations.

## Insights & Observations
- Identified common patterns in complaints and fixes.
- Recognized frequent root causes that could help improve product/service quality.
- Potential use case for automation via NLP-based classification models.

## Files in This Repository
- `datatagged_Dataset.xlsx`: The final tagged dataset.
- `DA - Task 1.xlsx`: Contains the original dataset, taxonomy reference, and the summary report.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## How to Use
- Open the tagged dataset to explore the assigned categories.
- Use the summary report for insights into the tagging process and observations.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement automated tagging using AI/ML techniques.
- Improve taxonomy coverage for better classification.
